title: Status code for failed job submission
date: 2021-07-05
---

There was plenty of ambiguity what status code should be used
in response to a job submission whose parameters did not pass
validation. At first, we used custom 420 status code which wasn't
very informative, so we then changed it to 400 Bad Request.
It was a better option, however, it was a bit misleading since
400 often indicates malformed request or client error which was not
the case. Then, [RFC 4918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918#section-11.2)
came to the rescue with 422 Unprocessable Entity that indicates
exactly what we needed - content type and syntax is correct
but server can't process the contained instructions.
